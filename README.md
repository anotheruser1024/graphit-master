# GraphIt

There is currently a lack of lightweight network visualisation software.
Existing network visualisation software often bombards unexperienced users
with too many choices making it difficult to access straightforward information
to help them understand their network. Our product “Graphit - Know Your Network”
is being designed with a view to being light and web-based as well as easy to
use with advanced features and analytics. As a team of 8 and with the help of
our client, our primary aim is designing a program to visually represent
networks uploaded by a user in a way that is simple and “user friendly”,
aimed at individuals who may want to learn more about their network or networks
that are publicly accessible. The software must also perform analysis on their
network and provide further information which may be of interest to them.
Information will include number of nodes and edges, graph density, node
centrality, and clustering coefficients. The program must also offer network
comparison, allowing user view and compare 2 networks.
